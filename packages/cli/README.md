# rsetup

Terminal-first CLI that composes, validates, and configures development stacks.

```bash
npx rsetup --help
```

This is the public npm name for RepoSetup. After `npm install -g rsetup`, both `rsetup` and `reposetup` work.

This is an **early-stage** `0.1.0` release. Integrations are not all equally mature. Use `--dry-run` before changing an important project.

The workspace libraries `@reposetup/core`, `@reposetup/registry`, and `@reposetup/integrations` are bundled into this package. They are not published separately.

Unscoped `reposetup` and `reposetup-cli` cannot be used: npm rejects them as too similar to existing `repo-setup` and `repo-setup-cli`.

# Implementation Status

Cursor/maintainers should update this file as phases are completed.

## Current phase

- [x] Phase 5 — CLI skeleton + dry-run
- [x] Phase 6 — Package-manager adapters
- [x] Phase 7 — First framework/integrations
- [x] Phase 8 — Executor
- [x] Phase 9 — First complete golden stack
- [x] Phase 10 — Project detection
- [x] Phase 11 — Add
- [x] Phase 12 — Doctor
- [x] Phase 13 — JS ecosystem expansion
- [x] Phase 14 — Python ecosystem
- [x] Phase 15 — Export/config stability
- [x] Phase 16 — Safe remove support
- [x] Phase 17 — v1 hardening
- [ ] Phase 18 — Release Hardening and Prerelease Qualification
  - [x] 18.0 Documentation and baseline
  - [x] 18.1 Golden-stack real execution tests (harness + B/C local; A/D/E blocked here)
  - [x] 18.2 Cross-platform CI qualification (workflows added; remote run pending)
  - [x] 18.3 npm package/artifact qualification
  - [x] 18.4 Failure-path and safety qualification
  - [x] 18.5 Integration maturity classification (candidates; none stable)
  - [x] 18.6 Release documentation
  - [x] 18.7 Release automation (publish remains opt-in / unconfigured)
  - [ ] 18.8 Alpha/release-candidate validation (Next.js, FastAPI, Flask, OS matrix still open locally)

## Last completed work

Public GitHub launch prep (2026-09-22): packages and CLI version `0.1.0`; public README; issue/PR templates; `.gitignore` hardening.

## Known blockers

- Next.js execute skipped locally when disk is tight.
- `uv` may be missing locally, so FastAPI/Flask goldens skip.
- First GitHub Actions run happens after origin exists.
- No npm trusted-publisher config. **Do not npm-publish in this launch.**
- No integration is `stable`.

## Golden stacks proven

| Stack | Dry-run plan | Real execute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Next.js / SQLite | yes | pending CI / `REPOSETUP_GOLDEN_NEXT=1` |
| React + Vite | yes | yes (local `pnpm test:golden`) |
| Express / Postgres config | yes | yes generation + `tsc --noEmit`; no live DB |
| FastAPI | yes | pending `uv` |
| Flask | yes | pending `uv` |

## OS environments proven

| OS | Local | GitHub Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | unit/lint/build/e2e/golden B+C | platform workflow on `main`/`dev` |
| Linux | not run here | ci + platform + golden workflows |
| Windows | not run here | platform workflow |

## Integrations promoted to stable

None.

## npm publishing status

Not published. Release workflow publish job is opt-in (`workflow_dispatch` + `publish=true`).

## Notes

Do not mark Phase 18 complete unless remaining Release Qualification gates in `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md` pass. GitHub `v0.1.0` is a source launch, not `1.0.0`.
